###Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock 

Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is the Week 7 project we worked on at [Makers Academy].<br>
We created an interface to let two people play [RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock], written in JavaScript and tested with [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/).<br>
This is my version.

====================

The project was developed in 5 versions.

##Version 1:

Implementing the game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" in Javascript following the Ruby logic given to us in order to make all of the Jasmine tests pass.

##Version 2:

Adding two new options into the mix: Lizard and Spock. Then creating custom winning messages that applied to all possible game results.

##Version 3:

Build a simple game interface, using JQuery event handlers to handle player choices and return the messages.

##Version 4:

Deploy to Heroku as a simple Sinatra application.

##Version 5:

Added prompts for players to add their names before the first round.
